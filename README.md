# Bachelor Thesis

This project was undertaken during the final year of my degree under the supervision of Prof. Giampaolo Liuzzi.

A Bayesian Optimization algorithm implemented with Ax to tune Hyperparameters for a Neural Network.

You can find an implementation of a Neural Network on the CIFAR10 dataset which has been used as the objective function for our algorithm.
There will be also provided an algorithm with the sole scope to provide useful graphs and data from the .JSON template and the exported data in .CSV.
