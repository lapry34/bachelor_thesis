# Bachelor Thesis

This project was undertaken during the final year of my degree under the supervision of Prof. Giampaolo Liuzzi.

A Bayesian Optimization algorithm implemented with Ax to tune Hyperparameters for a Neural Network.

An implementation of a Neural Network, utilizing the CIFAR10 dataset as the objective function for our algorithm, is available for reference. Additionally, an algorithm designed specifically to generate insightful graphs and data from the .JSON template and exported .CSV data will also be provided.
